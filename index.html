							<h2>Ancient Persia</h2></a></li>
							<p>Persia (roughly modern-day Iran) is among the oldest inhabited regions in the world. Archaeological sites in the country have established human habitation dating back to 10,000 BCE.By Immigration of Aryan at some point prior to the 3rd millennium BCE, the country would later be referenced as Ariana and Iran – the land of the Aryans.'Aryan' should be understood according to the ancient Iranian language of Avestan meaning “noble”, “civilized” or “free man” and designating a class of people, having nothing to do with race - or Caucasians in any way - but referring to Indo-Iranians who applied the term to themselves in the religious works known as the Avesta. This early Iranian religion held the god Ahura Mazda as the supreme.The Persian Empire or Imperial Iran is any one of the many imperial dynasties centered in Iran (Persia) that spanned several centuries— from the 6th century BCE, the Achaemenid Empire, to the 20th century CE, the Pahlavi dynasty.   </p>

								<h2>Persepolis</h2></a></li>
							<p>Persepolis was the ceremonial capital of the Achaemenid Empire (ca. 550–330 BC). Persepolis is situated 70 km northeast of the modern city of Shiraz in the Fars Province of modern Iran (ancient Parse). Founded by Darius the Great around 518 B.C., looted and burned by Alexander in 331–330 B.C. The site includes a 125,000 square metre terrace, partly artificially constructed and partly cut out of a mountain. Major tunnels for sewage were dug underground through the rock and a complex system of water channels and drainage was cut into the rocky terrace. Several palaces were then built on the terrace.
King Darius the Great 'invented' Persepolis as the splendid seat of the government of the Achaemenid empire and as its center for receptions and festivals. The wealth and might of Persia was to be visible in every aspect of its construction. Persepolis was a showcase. UNESCO declared the citadel of Persepolis a World Heritage Site in 1979</p>

								<h2>Historical Artifacts</h2></a></li>
							<p>The ancient Persians of the Achaemenid Empire created art in many forms, including metalwork, rock carvings, weaving and architecture. As the Persian Empire expanded to encompass other artistic centers of early civilization, a new style was formed with influences from these sources.</p>

								<h2>CONCEPT: Why Persepolis?</h2></a></li>
							<p>People have largely neglected the power of history. With an understanding of history, you know about the basic concepts and ideas. You there can learn about cause and effect, relationships, and human nature. It clarifies how things are related to each other. Ample knowledge of history lets people know about attitudes and feelings as resulting from an action. Knowing the history of a country tells about culture and ethnic diversity as to know its role. History helps in understanding that our position internationally, as a country, depends on the sacrifices made by our elders to make it how it is today. Without any understanding of history, no one can easily make any reference to these things. The history of our country is an ingrained part of each of us.
The idea of the Persepolis virtual museum came into my mind for some reasons. First of all, as you know the government in Iran does not pay enough attention to historical places in order to preserve them and many of these historical sights are unfortunately in grave danger of being totally destroyed. Secondly, due to the political issues surrounding Iran, tourists are not that much interested in traveling to Iran and last but not least regarding the current situation of COVID-19 it is not possible to travel freely like before so this project aims to design a full museum where virtual experiences coexist and are enhanced by the presence of trey historical artifacts, explanatory panels, and guided tours, that are features of the traditional museums.

									<h3>Development</h3>
									<p>Due to the importance of Persepolis platform as a symbol of magnificent historical period in Iran, I decided to design this project to create a website where to embed 360° Street view of different palaces and sections of this historical place, to give the user the sense of walking in the real Persepolis. Since the user might be curious about the real Persepolis architecture, I started the virtual tour by presenting a 3D model of old Persepolis, designed by 3D MAX, Autodesk Mudbox and Photoshop linked from Sketchfeb website in order to exemplifies the Achaemenid style of architecture.I complete each section description by adding a fullscreen 360 street view.  All views are linked from Stockholm360 and google map.
To enrich the user’s information about Achaemenian empire specially in terms of the cultural heritage, I created a virtual exhibition section for historical handmade artifacts which are belonged to these eras. the exhibition is set in a separate virtual building next to the Persepolis, which composite of 4 rooms for each object with description and 3D reproduction of each artifact. This virtual exhibition comes at last, on of the final sections of the website. Thanks to the international museum of ancient Iran and British Museum I was able to have access to 3D model of objects. All models are created with the help of the modeling tool Blender and the render engine Verge3D. users may have access to this section through a navigation menu at the top of the page.

									<h3>Technology</h3>
									<p>•	360° Google Street Views -Google Street View is a feature of Google Maps that enables users to view and navigate through 360 degree horizontal and 290-degree vertical panoramic street level images of various cities around the world. It provides interactive panoramas from positions along many streets in the world of stitched images.  
•	3D Modeling tools: Blender and 3D MAX, photoshop. The 3D models were downloaded from an open source archive. The size and color of some images were changed by photoshop to get fit to my website layout also on google slide
•	Web development tools: HTML, CSS and BOOTSTRAP 4

									<h3>users</h3>
									<p>The aim of any virtual reality is to blend virtual with real which is usually happens by developing, user-friendly interface. This can be really important specially in terms of cultural artifacts and even historical places like Persepolis which do not exist anymore. We can reach to this goal by providing a place for experiencing history and doing an investigation among objects that they do not exist anymore or they are on some sort of protection due to historical importance and rare existence. By choosing 360 street view I tried as much as possible to build sections that are self-explanatory, with a clear layout, an easy way to navigate through. The user can explore the 3D environment of the views, zooming and rotating to every direction, as if he or she was actually "immersed" in the real environment. Furthermore, in the exhibition section I add a 3Dmodel of objects  to provide a better and more real understanding of historical objects in terms of the size and dimension and how they are created (more details can be catch in 3dmodels). Last but not least, This is the first website about Achaemenian empire and obviously it needs more improvement, and receiving user feedback can be a great source for doing this, though I created a chat box for having direct contact with user to receive their opinions and recommendations for having a better virtual museums in the future.</p>
