<h2> style="text-align:center">Palace Complex: Structures, Reliefs, and Inscriptions </h2>
 <p> According to tablets inscribed in Old Persian and Elamite found at Persepolis, it seems that Darius planned this impressive complex of palaces not only as the seat of government but also, and primarily, as a show place and a spectacular center for the receptions and festivals of the Achaemenian kings and their empire. In dealing with the Persepolis platform, we have to understand that the northern part of the Terrace, consisting mainly of the Audience Hall of the Apadana, the Throne Hall, and the Gate of Xerxes, represented the official section of the Persepolis complex, accessible to a restricted public. The other part held the Palaces of Darius and Xerxes, the Harem, the Council Hall, and such. Following is a brief enumeration of the buildings, and their most outstanding features, that constitute the Terrace complex.</p>

    <h2>THE GREAT STAIRWAY</h2>
<p>The construction of the large Stairs of All Nations in Persepolis was ordered by king Xerxes (486-465), the son and successor of the founder of the city, Darius I the Great. Originally, the main access had been in the south; now, one had to ascend to the terrace from the west.
The Grate Stairway of Persepolis is a monumental double-ramped stairway, which was designed in such a way that one could only proceed slowly and with dignity, because you are forced to walk upright.

<br>
    <h2>THE GATE OF ALL NATIONS</h2>
<br>
<p>This Gate was the entrance place for kings, royalty, and visitors of the Achaemenid kings. Persepolis has three portals and you enter from the Western one. on both sides of the western portal, there are two bulls with human faces that are looking at the west. You confront these two bulls with human faces placed on two platforms that are 1.5 meters high while ascending the stairs. These two figures, called Lamassu (bull-man). The face adornments of these two figures are formed with a curly beard. between these two figures and on the walls each are established, are tablets in three languages and three types of cuneiform. The tablet facing the west (facing the field) is in the Elamite language. The middle tablet is written in ancient Persian language and the tablet facing east (facing the hall) is in the Babylonian or Akkadian language

<br>
<h2>THE THRONE HALL</h2>
<br>
<p>The Throne Hall (also called the “Hundred-Column Hall”), constituted of eight stone doorways which are decorated on the south and north with reliefs of throne scenes and on the east and west with scenes depicting the king in combat with monsters. In addition, the northern portico of the building is flanked by two colossal stone bulls. In the beginning of Xerxes’ reign, the Throne Hall was used mainly for receptions for representatives of all the subject nations of the empire. Later, when the Treasury proved to be too small, the Throne Hall also served as a storehouse and, above all, as a place to display more adequately objects, both tribute and booty, from the royal treasury</p>

   <h2>THE APADANA PALACE</h2>
<br>
<p>By far the largest and most magnificent building is the Apadana, begun by Darius and finished by Xerxes, that was used mainly for great receptions by the kings. Thirteen of its seventy-two columns still stand on the enormous platform to which two monumental stairways, on the north and on the east, give access. They are adorned with rows of beautifully executed reliefs showing scenes from the New Year’s festival and processions of representatives of twenty-three subject nations of the Achaemenid Empire, with court notables and Persians and Medes, followed by soldiers and guards, their horses, and royal chariots. </p>

<br>
   <h3> Apadana stairs</h3>
   <p>On the central scene of the relief of Apadana's eastern stairs there are eight soldiers, Persians and Medes. The Persians belong to the regiment of "Immortals". They are ready for battle, carrying a sword, spear, and shield. Above them is a traditional representation of a winged sun, flanked by two sphinxes.
The eastern stairs of the Apadana at Persepolis with exquisite stone relief that miraculously survived the sack of Persepolis by the soldiers of Alexander the Great in 330 BCE. The relief consists of three parts: the northern wall, with representations of Achaemenid dignitaries; the center, with eight soldiers; and the southern wall (seen here), show a procession of people from different subject nations bringing tribute to the Achaemenid king, Darius the Great (r.522-486).</p>

 <br>
 <br>
  <h2>THE TRIPYLON PALACE</h2>
<br>
<p>To the left of the east staircase of the apadana is another smaller set of stairs, which leads to the Tripylon. Here, the carvings include a variation on the theme of the lion and bull fight, a sphinx and processions of guards and dignitaries, but there are no representations of the vassal nations. The doorjambs of the north and south doors of the Tripylon show King Darius followed by two servants holding a fan and a parasol, while the opening of the east door shows the king seated on his throne under the winged symbol of Ahura Mazda, and held up by the twenty-eight vassal nations.</p>

<br>
     <h2>THE Darius PALACE</h2>
<br>
<p>This palace was one of the few structures that escaped destruction in the burning of the complex by Alexander. The Tachara, measuring 1,160 square meters (12,486 sq. feet), is the smallest of the palace buildings in Persepolis. Its main room is a mere 15.15m x 15.42 m (49.70 ft. x 50.59 ft.) with three rows of four columns.</p>

<br>
 <h2>THE ROYAL TOMB</h2>
<br>
<p>The Royal Tomb of Artaxesxes II, cut into the mount. As is customary, the relief on the upper part of the tomb shows the king sacrificing to the eternal, sacred fire and the supreme god Ahuramazda. He is standing on a platform that is carried by people that represent the subject nations.</p>
