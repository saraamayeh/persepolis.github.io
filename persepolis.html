<h2>Palace Complex: Structures, Reliefs, and Inscriptions </h2>
 <p> According to tablets inscribed in Old Persian and Elamite found at Persepolis, it seems that Darius planned this impressive complex of palaces not only as the seat of government but also, and primarily, as a show place and a spectacular center for the receptions and festivals of the Achaemenian kings and their empire. In dealing with the Persepolis platform, we have to understand that the northern part of the Terrace, consisting mainly of the Audience Hall of the Apadana, the Throne Hall, and the Gate of Xerxes, represented the official section of the Persepolis complex, accessible to a restricted public. The other part held the Palaces of Darius and Xerxes, the Harem, the Council Hall, and such. Following is a brief enumeration of the buildings, and their most outstanding features, that constitute the Terrace complex.</p>

            <h3>The two Towers: La Torre degli Asinelli and La Torre Garisenda</h3>
            <p>
              The two towers are the symbol of Bologna, they stand in the heart of the city, where the ancient Aemilian Way entered Bologna. The towers were both built in the same years (from 1109 to 1119). They had a military purpose, mainly defensive.

            <ul>
              <li><i class="icofont-check-circled"></i> The "Torre degli Asinelli" is the tallest medieval leaning tower: a 97,02-meters-tall building that has 496 steps in total. It was built by Asinelli noble family and it was recently restaurated. In the XIII century the tower was donated to the town. The Torre degli Asinelli is currently opened to the public and, from the top, it is possible to admire one of the most stunning panoramic views of Bologna.</li>
              <li><i class="icofont-check-circled"></i> The "Torre Garisenda" is instead much shorter ("just" almost 48 meters tall) compared to "its companion". The tower was built in the same years and for the same purposes, even though it was soon shortened for the risk of collapse. In fact, the Garisenda was famous since Dante's period for a peculiarity: its subfoundations are partially beneath the ground, this slope caused its shortening. From the 15th until the 19th centuries, Garisenda had been property of the "Arte dei Drappieri", that used the place as a commercial palace. It was then donated to the Municipality. This tower cannot be visited.</li>
